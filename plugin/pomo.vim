" What pomo.md could look like:
" # Todo
" - [x] Do this
" - [x] Do that
"
" # Pomo 2
" ## Todo
" - [x] Do that
"
" ## Brief
" - Viewed this
"
" # Pomo 1
"
" ## Todo
" - [x] Do this
" - [ ] Do that
"
" ## Brief
" - [x] Done these too
" - Difficulty in doing that

" Ideally the file would appear in a floating window (but pain in the a..)
